                            Technology is more than just a field of study for me, it's a passion that fuels my drive to innovate, solve problems, and create meaningful impact. As a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Jaffna, I actively engage in both technical and leadership roles. Serving as the Secretary and Webmaster of the IEEE Computer Society, I contribute to fostering a thriving tech community, organizing events, and managing digital platforms to enhance engagement<br /><br />

                            My industry experience includes a web developer internship, where I worked on bug fixing, error checking, and development tasks, sharpening my problem-solving abilities and technical expertise. Additionally, my team was selected among the top 5 in the prestigious World Fuel Asia 2023 Innovation Competition by Futurizeâ€”an achievement that strengthened my collaborative mindset and innovative thinking<br /><br />

                            With a strong foundation in Java, JavaScript, React, and Node.js, I am always eager to take on new challenges, refine my skills, and contribute to impactful projects. I thrive in dynamic environments and look forward to pushing boundaries in software development through creativity, teamwork, and continuous learning.
